Project moved to a new repository under Stream Cinema Community project:
https://gitlab.com/stream-cinema-community/db-checker

Thie repository is no longer updated!

This script adds Stream Cinema Community logo on CSFD, IMDB, Trakt and TMDB pages if movie (TV show) exists in SCC database.

To work properly, you must install Tempermonkey addon to your browser and add this javascript file (sc2-integrate.user.js) to this addon. If done, you will see SCC logo on web pages in movie (TV show) page in case this movie or TV show exists in SC2 database.
